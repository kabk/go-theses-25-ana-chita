      <p class="subtitle"><strong>➽ Introduction:</strong></p>
      <p class="p1">
        Graphic design is a term often misunderstood, yet omnipresent in our
        lives. When I mention that I study graphic design, I am frequently asked,
        "What does that involve?". This question highlights that not everyone is
        aware of this profession, which, among its many functions, has
        historically been used for both informing and manipulating. Maybe the
        little information was caused by the lack of importance Romania offered to
        arts and culture in the last decade, or maybe because it was not
        considered important in any way. Either way, this oversight has influenced
        not only how Romanian people perceive design today but also how they
        engage with visual culture and communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Romania, graphic design remains an understudied subject, despite
        playing a significant role during periods of major political and cultural
        transformation. In the 20th century, the field underwent
        dramatic changes, from interwar modernism to communist censorship and
        post-communist freedom, with graphic design being shaped by these forces.
        The history of Romanian graphic design remains largely undocumented,
        partly due to the reluctance of the communist regime to record it, as
        doing so might have meant acknowledging the Western influences that had
        once shaped Romanian design

        Therefore, the impact of cultural exchanges and political changes on
        Romanian graphic design deserves closer examination.

        As a graphic design student who was born in Romania but has only a limited
        understanding of the country's graphic design heritage, I am studying my
        roots through my fascination with periodical publications: The Woman
        Almanac (Almanah Femeia), The Village Almanac (Almanahul satelor), Science
        and Technology (Stiinta si Tehnica), The Automobile (Automobilul), The
        Store Almanac (Almanahul Magazin), The Flame Almanac (Almanahul Flacara),
        The Spark Almanac (Amanah Scânteia), The Brave Ones Almanac (Almanahul
        Cutezătorii), Romanian Illustration (Romanian Illustration), and Ileana.
        These publications serve as my primary research materials, offering
        valuable insights into the history of Romanian graphic design. My
        speculative research aims to shift focus on this century of design,
        understand magazines as a series of design decisions with specific goals
        and reasoning, and create a dialogue of power, politics, and design.

        My interest was sparked by the magazines I discovered during my most
        recent visit to Romania. The periodical magazines spanning from 1900 to
        2000: The Woman Almanac (Almanah Femeia), The Village Almanac (Almanahul
        satelor), Science and Technology (Stiinta si Tehnica), The Automobile

        To properly understand the beginning of the 20th century, one must look
        back at the history of the late 19th century. In the early 1860s, the
        country transitioned from the Cyrillic alphabet to the Latin one<a class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"

        </span> and in 1866, Carol I appeared as the new ruler of Romania. Under his
        leadership, they declared independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1877.
        This ushered in a period of modernization and growth, accompanied by the
        emergence of the middle class and <a class="citat1">an avalanche of writers and painters<a class="footnote-ref"
            id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></a>. The production of books was rising, and with it
        appeared a series of
        periodical publications, some of them making it to the 20th century.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"

        Still trying to standardize Romanian diacritics, using French accents as
        the hat for ă, typographical evolution was becoming evident.
      </p>
      <p>
        Until 1947, Romania was a constitutional monarchy with clear influences
        from Western artistic movements, adapted to Romanian politics. For
        example, Art Nouveau is exemplified in the magazine Ileana (1900-1901),
        which was a significant publication for this style.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
          role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a><span class="sidenote" id="sn6">

          <a class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a>
        </span>
        The magazine was one of the first artistic publications produced in
        Romania, emerging from a Romanian artists' community "Societatea pentru
        Dezvoltarea Artelor in Romania - Ileana".<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
          role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>
        The magazine's role was to <a class="citat1">develop a dialogue with European art<a href="#fn8"
            class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></a> by inviting Western artists to
        collaborate, having magazine covers
        reminiscent of contemporary Venice or Munich publications. Due to
        Romania's open borders, influences were visible, not just Art Deco but
        also Constructivism from Russia and Bauhaus from Germany.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another magazine that stood out to me is Ilustrațiunea Română (Romanian
        Illustration). I had the opportunity to obtain one issue and later
        discovered more in online archives. Even though there is little to no
        information about this magazine, I know of the production period from 1914
        to 1939. The design of the magazine, as well as the topics, speaks enough
        about the clear influences of Western ideologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Subsequently, when the communist period began in 1947, circumstances
        drastically changed. The borders were closed, and influences from abroad
        became far less visible over time. All independent typography shops and
        liberal press outlets were shut down.<a class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"

        The printing industry was nationalized, and every publication required
        approval from the Communist Party. With propaganda being the main goal of
        press nationalization, the PAD (The Propaganda and Agitation
        Department) was a tool for creating a Soviet-style
        culture monitored by the Communist Party.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
          role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>
        Its primary objectives included suppressing cultural diversity and
        enforcing political censorship in arts and education, forcing artists to
        adopt Marxist-Leninist ideology.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
          role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>
        Creative unions were reorganized to enforce ideological conformity (e.g.,
        Socialist Realism as the only accepted art form), and cultural criticism
        targeted influential figures, for example Tudor Arghezi.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"

        The communist regime aimed to create a uniform cultural and intellectual
        environment. Romanian intellectuals complied due to harsh repression by
        the secret police and their manipulative strategies. Under constant
        surveillance by agitators and spies, creating anything outside the rigid
        rules was extremely difficult. Those who managed to do so and were
        discovered would <a class="citat1">risk falling out of favour with the authorities, with
          grave consequences: Artists who publicly disavowed the communist regime
          faced the removal of their materials from school curricula, prohibition
          from producing new works, and imprisonment. Some would just disappear.<a class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"

        The pre-communist era is crucial for understanding Romania's cultural

        modernity. Although publications from this period are poorly documented

      the pages, with tourism and travel being frequently mentioned topics. The

        the front page, often highlighted royal events and figures in a highly
        favourable light, reinforcing a sense of national pride and unity under
        the monarchy. The magazines were not operated under strict political
        directives; however, they did reflect and foster certain ideological
        leanings, namely, pro-monarchy sentiment and Western admiration, thus
        acting as a tool to create a discourse around it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence, the images and illustrations in Ilustrațiunea Română (Romanian
        Illustration) were far more than simple decorations: they became the vocal
        point behind the magazine's modern appeal and helped shape an emerging
        Romanian visual identity before the communist era.
      </p>
      <p>
        The changes in the design of the publications became extremely clear when
        the communist party ultimately established itself, and it was impossible
        not to tie the changes with the political shifts. Every piece of print
        created and circulated inside Romania was either printed or carefully
        chosen. Based on the findings in my research materials, it seems that all
        printed items were meticulously designed with a distinct objective: they
        were intended to create a narrative of the virtues and grandeur of
        communism. It is important to understand that all things produced then
        were a form of propaganda, using any type of visual elements to shape
        collective identity and political loyalty. The magazines were meant to
        reach every layer of society, making sure the message comes across
        everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Striking colours and bold covers marked the most noticeable changes. We
        can associate the usage of colours with the modernization of printing
        techniques, but it is more important how the colours were applied, more
        than their mere appearance. All design elements aimed to capture
        attention: the usage of primary colours and bold, distinctive visuals
        meant to divert the public from the grim realities of communism. All the
        graphic elements depicted liveliness and optimism. Many graphic details
        appear repeatedly: colourful borders meant to isolate and offer importance
        to the articles/pictures, circled or highlighted parts of text making
        clear the key points, arrows and numbering/bullet points wanting an easy
        and precise way of reading or looking at the magazines and, minimal white
        space. The intention was to deliver massive amounts of information in a
        visually forceful way, leaving little room for imagination. The repetitive
        use of certain design motifs was to reinforce the ideological messages.

        We can reasonably assume the pictures used in postcards aim for the same
        goal as the pictures and illustrations featured in the periodical
        publications. At the beginning of the 1940s, illustrations were still
        prominently used in publications. However, with the advancement of
        printing techniques, photographs became increasingly dominant within their
        pages. They wanted to narrate a clear perspective of the (wanted to be
        seen as) modern, beautiful Romania that exists because of them.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"

        To properly understand the role of photographic content the communist-era
        publications examined in this thesis must be separated on two categories:
        scientific/technical ones, such as Știință și Tehnică(Science and
        Technology)<em> </em>and<em> </em>Automobilul (The Automobile), which
        focus on innovation and technology, and cultural/social/political ones,
        like Alamanahul Flacăra (The Flame Almanac), Almanahul<em> </em>Scînteia
        (The Spark Almanac)<em>,</em> and Almanahul Femeia(The Woman Alamanac),
        which cover topics ranging from politics and propaganda to lifestyle,
        culture, and rural life.

        On the other hand, if we talk about cultural and political magazines, the
        imagery changes completely, and the visual discourse is modified with it.

      <p>
        Upon opening one of these cultural/political magazines, readers were often
        met with portraits of the then-dictator, Nicolae Ceaușescu. Typically,
        these photographs depicted a resolute leader, evoking seriousness, and
        power. Lighting, coloration, and golden framing were employed to
        underscore his perceived perfection, one that you want and should be proud
        of having. Sometimes, the first pages would include a series of staged
        images wanting to show a false reality, trying to keep it close to the

        Such images might depict Ceausescu and his wife visiting factories, taking
        pictures with workers, Elena Ceausescu receiving flowers from another
        woman and often highlight interactions with children. All these pictures
        want to portray this perfect but effortless moments, so they look human
        and loved by the society, also visible in Figure 6. These visuals aimed to
        forge an emotional link, deploying compassion, love, admiration, or
        fear,<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a>
        so the audience can view them as portrayed. After the overly propagandist
        images, the magazine showcased different types of citizens being happy:
        woman cleaning, hugging their kids, breast-feeding; all the pictures
        represent an idealistic heteronormative obedient society in which the
        mother's role was to create offspring and family and the father was a
        provider. Towards the end of the magazines are the advertisement spreads,
        showing modern people dressed in fancy and expensive clothing, vacuums,
        expensive carpets, electronics. Although unattainable for most of the
        Romanian populace, their inclusion suggested an alignment with
        international standards, subtly discouraging readers from questioning
        their own social or economic realities.

        The role of illustrations and photographs has evolved over time. In the
        pre-communist era, they were used to contextualize a reality distant from
        Romania, while during communism, they served to construct a false reality.
        Visual imagery has maintained its power and influence, though today it's
        easier than ever to create deceptive realities. For instance, artificial
        intelligence and deepfake technologies now enable the rapid creation of
        manipulated images and scenarios, being used to manipulate, and shape
        information for public consumption. Creating staged scenarios to showcase
        leaders' falsely portrayed beauty is no longer necessary, it can be
        accomplished with just a few clicks and tweets.

        In the previous chapter, I have addressed the importance of graphic
        elements, images, and illustrations as tools to influence and help the
        design reach the needed goal, whether we talk about the pre-communist
        period or the communist era. To fully understand the goal of the
        magazines, as well as their influences, we must equally understand
        the pivotal role of typography in shaping the look and reception of
        magazines.

        Going back to the pre-communist era, as photography and illustrations were

        cultural shifts toward modernization.

        Looking back at our initial material, we can see that all the magazines of
        Ilustrațiunea Română (Romanian Illustration) use a modern serif, the serif
        was used in European prints at the time. The headings as well as the text,
        used a similar serif, sometimes in bold or all caps. Due to the limited
        options of typefaces available, you can often see mixing display variants
        for headlines. Moreover, a used option was the handwritten titles, being
        quite playful and casual, adding a new layer of expressive quality and
        making it more personal.

        The typographical decisions reflect the in-between period, meeting the
        modernist, western influences with the traditional print. They demonstrate

        institutionalize people's discourse, making it easy to control. The

        bold, sans-serif, though they sometimes varied between serif small caps,

          The body of text was justified and arranged in one to three columns, like
          pre-communist publications. The layout prioritized clarity, with a clear
          hierarchy of information. Headings and key information stood out through
          highlighting, while supporting text was neatly organized. Colourful
          borders, circles, and rectangles framed text blocks, while arrows and

        an overwhelming flood of information, from cover to inner cover to first

        The experience left readers no room to pause or reflect; each glance

        result of the major changes in the economical scene in Romania and the
        lack of importance to the typographical matters, causing a lack of paper,

        The magazines were mass produced and their making prioritized quantity
        over quality, as the Communist Party wanted to save as much printed
        material as they could.<a class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a>
        Misprints were common, with text sometimes so misaligned it became nearly
        illegible, yet the magazines continued to circulate. These imperfections,
        which now hold their own unique beauty, revealed the regime's desperate
        push to disseminate their message, regardless of presentation quality.
        This reflected a broader pattern in communist governance: the end goal of
        controlling citizen behaviour mattered more than the means of achieving
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The magazines' production quality reflected clear editorial priorities:
        front pages featured bold, colourful propaganda images, middle sections
        used minimal single-color printing, and back sections returned to vibrant
        colours for advertisements and idealized depictions of life.
      </p>
      <p class="last-paragraph">
        In both the communist and pre-communist eras, mass-produced magazines
        feature column body text, engaging titles with striking typography,
        elements still widely used today. The shifts in type choices have evolved
        over time. When examining layouts, mass-produced publications today
        resemble those from the pre-communist era in terms of white space and
        spatial organization. However, there is less need now to overfill pages
        with excessive information, as production has increased, there are now 200
        magazines covering the same topic, whereas before, there was only one.
        Today, the competition over the market position is a daily reality. While
        the phenomenon of information overload existed in the past throughout
        these magazines it shifted to the overwhelming nature of today's age via
        digital and analogue outlets, the information being more saturated than
        ever.

      <p class="subtitle"><strong>➙ A personal note</strong></p>
      <p class="p1">
        My grandmother was a teacher during communist times, and you can always
        hear a nostalgic note in her speech that era; she was lucky. She was
        trained to love and teach communist principles, embracing order and the
        worker mentality. Some of my magazines came from her collection, and she
        explained to me how many people in the big cities had subscriptions to
        these magazines delivered directly to their homes.
      </p>
      <p>
        She always mentions, when we talk about my thesis, how happy and proud she
        was when she and her class appeared in Cutezatorii (The Brave Ones). She
        organized a pioneering activity with the students, where everyone wore
        their specific uniform while gardening in the flowerbed. Every class had
        their own flowerbed to tend. She took a picture and sent it to the
        publication, along with a description. The editors changed and rewrote her
        text to say, "Students who love gardening and flowers, love life and
        what's beautiful." My grandma considered the description beautiful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing these kinds of stories always shocks me or at least puzzles me,
        especially how much pride and normality my grandma sees in them. She would
        tell me how everyone was wearing their uniforms even outside of school and
        how students were showing respect and gratitude towards the teachers and
        never questioned authority. The students in high school had their
        registration number on their hats, thus they could be easily identified.
        All the students then were good students, in my grandma's beliefs,
        students now don't show respect and misbehave. The fairytales told by the
        communist party are in parts my grandma's reality. Not questioning
        authority and taking things for granted gave her a sense of stability,
        that nowadays, she believes has been lost.

      <p class="subtitle"><strong>➛ Conclusion</strong></p>
      <p class="p1">
        As I look back on my research, it becomes clear that graphic design and
        editorial illustration have never been just visual add-ons; they have
        always been powerful tools shaping both perception and reality. Delving
        into these Romanian periodical publications, from the elaborate Art
        Nouveau-style covers of Ilustrațiunea Română (Romanian Illustration) to
        the heavily curated images of communist-era magazines, highlights the way
        design choices are deeply intertwined with political ambitions, cultural
        identities, and social aspirations. All decision making per se when we
        communicate, can be of a political aftermath, images and texts are the
        very medium for marketing, and conveying messages, sometimes,
        unfortunately also propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
        The magazines that I collected and investigated were used to inform,
        encouraging a dialogue of the Romanian population with the West during
        pre-communism, and ended up creating false narratives without a broader
        perspective throughout communism. The false narrative was a false
        prosperity caused by the communists, reality being a severe repression,
        censorship, and the suppression of individual freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, the magazines transformed from an instrument to inform citizens to
        one that manipulated citizens. Design had the ability to both mirror
        societal changes and to steer them in certain directions. Whether the
        magazines are reinforcing a monarchy's grandeur, encouraging a budding
        middle class to embrace modern ideals, or carefully constructing a vision
        of communist prosperity<a class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a><span

      <p class="last-paragraph">
        This limited archive and the political contextualization brought some
        light onto this missing piece of Romanian design history. Looking at these
        magazines I was able to understand the visual language and what design
        decisions were based on, creating a perceivable dialogue between design
        and politics. The speculative research challenged my understanding of
        design choices while also revealing the historical obstacles Romania had
        to navigate.
